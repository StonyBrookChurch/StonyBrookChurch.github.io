The building that is the Millard, Nebraska home of Stony Brook Church was once home to Millard Bible Church, a United States Mennonite Brethren church planted in 1993 by the USMB Central District Conference.
In 1997, Millard Bible planted a church in Papillion, Nebraska.
The church began as Cross Tunes, a Christian music and bookstore that doubled as a place of worship.
Marking the beginning of an ever-growing ministry, Cross Tunes became Rolling Hills Church, which was eventually renamed Shadow Lake Community Church (SLCC).
While SLCC continued non-stop growth, Millard Bible Church transitioned out of the Millard building.
In 2008 SLCC launched a video satellite ministry in the available Millard building.
SLCC Millard Campus became an alternative worship location for SLCC members from West Omaha, while creating opportunities for new connections in the Millard area.
A fresh vision for SLCC-Millard was cast in 2009.
Leadership and congregation were already in place in Millard and the decision was made to recognize the ministry as a self-supporting church plant with a unique vision.
In October 2010, in the same location where the story began, the body of believers in Millard became Stony Brook Church.
